## Homework 3-3
Given a client program `RightTriangleClient.java` under the directory `src`.

 Implement a `RightTriangle` class that is used by the `RightTriangleClient` program. 
 Your `RightTriangle` class should consists of the following attributes and methods.
 
 * a `private` `double` attribute, named `base` for storing the value of the triangle's base.
 * a `private` `double` attribute, named `height` for storing the value of the triangle's height. 
 * an `accessor` method, named `getBase()` that returns the size of the triangle's base.
 * an `accessor` method, named `getHeight()` that returns the size of the triangle's height.
 * a `public` method, named `calcHypotenuse()` that returns the size of the hypotenuse of the right triangle.
 * a `public` method, named `calcArea()` that returns the area of the right triangle.
 
**Note** DO NOT CHANGE the content of the client program `RightTriangleClient.java`.!!!
 
* If your implementation of the class `RightTriangle` is correct. Then, the program `RightTriangleClient.java` will 
 produce output as in the following examples.

#### Example Run 1
```
$ java RightTriangleClient   
3 4
3.00,4.00,5.00,6.00
``` 
 
#### Example Run 2
```
$ java RightTriangleClient   
5 12
5.00,12.00,30.00,13.00 
```
